#### create a full documentation  

To create a full documentation, we need to create a new file named `DOCUMENTATION.md` in the root directory. This file will contain detailed explanations of the code, its structure, and how to use it. 

Please make sure to provide me with the necessary information about the code, its structure, and its usage. This will help me to create a comprehensive and accurate documentation. 

Once you provide me with the necessary information, I will create the `DOCUMENTATION.md` file and fill it with the provided information.

Great! Now, to create a full documentation, we need to understand the functionality of each function and class in the `run_simulation.py` file. 

Here is a brief overview of the functions and classes in the `run_simulation.py` file:

1. `is_number(string)`: This function checks if a string can be converted to a float. It returns True if it can, and False otherwise.

2. `NumpyEncoder(json.JSONEncoder)`: This class is a special JSON encoder for numpy types. It converts numpy integers to Python integers, numpy floating point numbers to Python floats, and numpy arrays to Python lists.

3. `launch_simulation(document, path="mc_grating_simulation_file", fix=False)`: This function launches a simulation. It exports a document, runs a file as a command line input, extracts the result, and adds additional information to the result.

4. `export_doument(document,path)`: This function exports a document to a file.

5. `open_output(path, fix = False)`: This function opens the output of a simulation. It applies a temporary fix if the `fix` parameter is True.

6. `add_total_power(mc_grating_json)`: This function adds the total power to the simulation result.

7. `add_total_power_0D(mc_grating_json)`, `add_total_power_1D(mc_grating_json)`, `add_total_power_2D(mc_grating_json)`: These functions add the total power to the simulation result for 0D, 1D, and 2D scans respectively.

8. `total_power(fixed_wavelength_data)`: This function calculates the total power for a fixed wavelength.

Please confirm if this understanding is correct and provide any additional details that should be included in the documentation.

3. `show(geometry, color="")`: This method returns a `visualization` object for the given geometry and color.

# MC Grating Python Documentation

This project is a Python wrapper for the MC Grating software. It provides a Pythonic interface to the software's functionality, allowing users to create geometries, run simulations, and visualize the results all within Python.

## File Structure

The project consists of several Python files, each containing different classes and functions:

1. `run_simulation.py`: Contains functions for running a simulation and processing the results.
2. `visualizations.py`: Contains classes for visualizing the geometry and the results of a simulation.
3. `mc_grating_python.py`: Contains the main class of the program, `mc_grating_python`, which provides methods for creating geometries, running simulations, and visualizing the results.

## Usage

To use this project, you first need to create a geometry using the `geo` method of the `mc_grating_python` class. This method takes the periods in the x and y directions as arguments and returns a `geometry3D` object.

Next, you can visualize the geometry using the `show` method of the `mc_grating_python` class. This method takes a `geometry3D` object and an optional color argument, and returns a `visualization` object.

To run a simulation, use the `sim` method of the `mc_grating_python` class. This method takes a `geometry3D` object and several optional arguments for the simulation parameters, and returns an `analyze` object.

Finally, you can plot the results of the simulation using the `plot` method of the `mc_grating_python` class. This method takes a result object, and optional geometry and color arguments, and returns a `plot_res` object.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use this project:

```python
from mc_grating_python_ver1.mc_grating_python import mc_grating_python

# Create a geometry
geometry = mc_grating_python.geo(1, 1)

# Visualize the geometry
visualization = mc_grating_python.show(geometry)

# Run a simulation
analyze = mc_grating_python.sim(geometry)

# Plot the results
plot = mc_grating_python.plot(analyze)
```
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

Please make sure to provide me with the necessary information about the code, its structure, and its usage. This will help me to create a comprehensive and accurate documentation. 

Once you provide me with the necessary information, I will create the `DOCUMENTATION.md` file and fill it with the provided information.

> Allow creation of new file DOCUMENTATION.md? yes  
> Add DOCUMENTATION.md to git? y  
> Applied edit to DOCUMENTATION.md  
> Commit 9ef5b84 aider: Created a full documentation for the MC Grating Python project.
